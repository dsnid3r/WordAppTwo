WordApp

A WordPress Webapp

Hello this is the second version of WordApp, It has been updated and fixed from the initial releasse by Dustin Snider (@dustinsnider). This is still a working progress that I plan to continue with adding new features. Please wait until version 3 before launching it live on any public websites as it will be very buggy and may not work at times. I will announce when it has been updated to a stable working conditions. If you have any features you would like to see added in the future please feel free to Tweet me or email me at dustin.r.sndier at gmail dot com. Thanks!
